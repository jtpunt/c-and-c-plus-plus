	gcc -o ftpserver ftpserver.c

To execute the server chat program, run the following command:
	./ftpserver 20000
	./ftpserver [port #]

To compile the client chat program and have ftpserver send its directory to the client, run the following command:
		python3 ftpclient.py localhost 20000 -l 0 20001
		python3 ftpclient.py flip1 20000 -l 0 20001
USAGE:	python3 ftpclient.py [SERVER_HOST] [SERVER_PORT] [COMMAND] [FILENAME] [DATA_PORT]

To compile the client chat program and have the ftpserver send a specific file in it's directory, run the following command:
		python3 ftpclient.py localhost 20000 -g test.txt 20001
		python3 ftpclient.py flip1 20000 -g someFile.txt 20001
USAGE:	python3 ftpclient.py [SERVER_HOST] [SERVER_PORT] [COMMAND] [FILENAME] [DATA_PORT]
