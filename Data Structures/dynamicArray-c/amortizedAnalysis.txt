1. It costs 56 units in the entire process of performing 32 consecutive push operations 
   on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the array will double
   in capacity each time a new item is added to the already full dynamic array. As N (i.e.
   the number of pushes) grows larger, the big-oh complexity for push on an array that needs
   to be resized is O(n) (worst-case). Without the need to resize, the big-oh complexity for 
   a push is O(1) (best-case). On average, the big-complexity for a push of this problem is O(1)+.

2. It costs 260 units in the entire process of performing 32 consecutive push operations on
   an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the array will grow by a constant
   2 spaces each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic array. As N(i.e. the number
   of pushes) grows larger, the big-oh complexity for a push on an array that needs to be resized
   is O(n) (worst-case). Without the need to resize, the big-oh complexity for a push is O(1).
