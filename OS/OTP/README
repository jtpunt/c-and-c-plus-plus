Plaintext - information that you wish to encrypt and protect. Human Readable.
Ciphertext - The plaintext after it has been encrypted by your programs. 
	- Is not human-readable, and it fact cannot be cracked, if the OTP system is used correctly.
Key - The random sequence of characters that will be used to convert plaintext to ciphertext, and back again/
	- It must not be re-used, or else the encryption is in danger of being broken.
	
To use this program:
1. Compile the source code by giving execution rights to compileall
	- syntax: chmod u+x compileall
	- syntax: ./compileall

2. Generate a keygen to encrypt/decrypt messages sent between the server and client
	- syntax: ./keygen 256 > mykey

3. Start the chat server in the background to encrypt messages
	- syntax: ./otp_enc_d 57171 &

4. Start the chat server in the background to decrypt messages
	- syntax: ./otp_dec_d 57172 &

5. Encrypt the message
	- syntax: ./otp_enc plaintext1 mykey 57171
	- Alternate syntax: ./otp_enc plaintext1 mykey 57171 > myciphertext
	- Alternate syntax: ./otp_enc plaintext1 mykey 57171 > myciphertext &

6. Decrypt the message
	- syntax: ./otp_dec myciphertext mykey 57172 > myplaintext
